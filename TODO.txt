# TTD Util TODO

## Clean up and unify chat messages across all files

[ ] jailed players must be notifed when another player joins jailchat

[ ] jailed players must be notified that they have been jailed (even though it's kinda obvious lol)

[ ] check if a player is already jailed before sending "player has been jailed" again to the admin

[ ] check if 'ranks' mod exists (https://github.com/octacian/ranks) and if so add compatability for it in jailchat

[ ] completely redo jailchat messages

## things that just need to be fixed

[ ] probably add alot more to this list --__--
